Bohanec, V. Rajkovic: Expert system for decision making. Sistemica 1(1), pp. 145-157, 1990.). The model evaluates cars according to the following concept structure:\\r\\n\\r\\nCAR                      car acceptability\\r\\n. PRICE                  overall price\\r\\n. . buying               buying price\\r\\n. . maint                price of the maintenance\\r\\n. TECH                   technical characteristics\\r\\n. .

Besides the target concept (CAR), the model includes three intermediate concepts: PRICE, TECH, COMFORT.
